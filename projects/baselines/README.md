# Corax baselines

This package contains examples and baseline agents developed with Corax.
It provides a starting point for developing new agents and running baseline experiments.

The code is organized such that each agent resides in a separate directory with a python
binary entrypoint (e.g. `main.py`) and configuration files (via ml_collections).
